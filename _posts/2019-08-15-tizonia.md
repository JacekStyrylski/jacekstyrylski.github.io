## Description
If you are command line fan like me, chances are that you'll try to use as many CLI tools as possible, recently I've found out about **[Tizonia](http://tizonia.org/)** -- open source project which allows you to connect to some of the most popular music services. 

List of currently available integrations:

- Spotify
- Music Google play
- SOUNDCLOUD
- YouTube
- Dirble
- Plex
- Google Chromecast

This is active project which have integration with Pandora and Tidal in the road map together with REPL command line interface.

## Installation

Tizonia is available for Debian/Ubuntu/Raspbian Linux family and Arch Linux. Also, you can install it, using Snap package or Docker image.

## Configuration

For the purpose of configuration there is `tizonia.conf` in your home directory, if you've installed it using Snap package manager it should be here: `~/snap/tizonia/current/.config/tizonia`, if other package manager was used then in this location `Debian or AUR packages: $HOME/.config/tizonia/tizonia.conf`.

If your favorite music service is Spotify you need to find its section in config file and edit in order to add user name and password. Remember about uncommenting (erase leading hash symbol) right lines.

```bash
# Spotify configuration
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# To avoid passing this information on the command line, uncomment
# and configure accordingly
#
spotify.user     = email@email.com
spotify.password = my_password
# spotify.recover_lost_token = false (set to true to continue playback after
#                                     the token has been [spuriously?] lost)
# spotify.allow_explicit_tracks = false (set to true to allow explicit tracks)
```

## Usage

In order to understand how should you run your favorite music, I strongly recommend to run help command i.e.:

`tizonia --help spotify`

```bash
Spotify options (Spotify Premium required):
  --spotify-user arg                    Spotify user name  (not required if
                                        provided via config file).
  --spotify-password arg                Spotify user password  (not required if

                                        Play Spotify recommendations by artist

  --spotify-recommendations-by-genre arg
                                        Play Spotify recommendations by genre
                                        name.
```

So if for example you'd like to listen to some recommendation based od piano genre, you can run it like that:

`tizonia --spotify-recommendations-by-genre piano`

When Tizonia is running there are following commands available:

- **p** - skip to previous file.
- **n** - skip to next file.
- **SPACE** - pause playback.
- **+/-** - increase/decrease volume.
- **m** - mute.
- **q** - quit.

This application can be run as a daemon, and it can chromecast to your devices. Unfortunately I wasn't able to make it running on WSL.
