I've started journey with Computer Science, back in the 1990s with Commodore 64,
these days I was just a kid, happy to play some games :). Some time later I've got my first PC,
it was equipped with Intel DX4 486 microprocessor, soon after I've started to manipulate with
autoexec.bat and config.sys to get a little bit more conventional memory. Since than I'm constantly
learning more about computers and I hope that this process will never end.

### More Information

The idea of this blog is to, anytime I learn something new, add it in the form of post. I hope that
this way, I'll not only help some other fellow developer but also I'll structurize better my knowledge
about mentioned topics.

### Disclaimer

I'm not English native speaker, I still keep learning that language too so if you will find any mistake,
please let me know and I'll try to fix as soon as possible.
